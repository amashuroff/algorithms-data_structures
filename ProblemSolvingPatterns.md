## Problem Solving Patterns.

---

### Frequency counters

- Pattern uses objects / sets to collect values / frequencies of values
- Often used to avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) ops. with arrays / strings

### Multiple pointers

- Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on certain condition
- Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.
