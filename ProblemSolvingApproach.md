\*\*\* How do you improve?

1. Devise a plan - Problem solving approach
2. Master common problem solving patterns

\*\*\* Problem solving approach.

1. Understand a problem
1. Explore concrete examples
1. Break it down
1. Solve/Simplify
1. Look back and refactor

\*\* Understand the problem: (Step back and understand the question/problem)

1. Restate problem in your own words
2. What are the I/O?
3. Can be outputs determined from the inputs? (may be skipped)
4. How should you label important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

\*\* Examine the edge cases, different inputs/cases (usually applied to real world problems)

\*\* Break it Down:

1. Explicitly write down the steps you need to take (pseudocode/comments)

\*\* Simplify:

1. Find the core difficulty
2. Temporarily ignore that difficulty
3. Write a simplified solution
4. Incorporate difficulty back in

\*\* Look back and refactor / questions / VERY IMPORTANT:

1. Can you check the result?
2. Can you derive the result differently?
3. Can you understand it at a glance?
4. Can you use the result in some other problem?
5. Can you improve the performance of your solution?
6. Can you think of other ways to refactor?
7. How have other people solved this problem?
